This was a translation of a project I built when I was in my first college porgramming class. It simplifies the process of creating a part order at a retail store. I translated it from JS into Python because I wanted my students to see that they could build real solutions to business problems with only 1 programming class. I used multiple of my own projects and a few of the projects from the TAs I hired to hit the point home. I intentionally left in all my original poor coding decisions including unclear comments because I wanted them to know they didn't need to wait until they were perfect coders to start solving real world problems.
